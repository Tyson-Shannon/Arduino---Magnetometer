# Arduino---Magnetometer
Used to detect solar flares and the impact eclipses have on magnetic field
<br>
I used this to see if I could detect an impact on the magnetic field during the April 8th, 2024 eclipse
<br>
with only ~75% coverage of the sun the impact on the magnetic field was measurable as the eclipse approached and left
